# rock-paper-scissors
A rock paper scissors project made as a part of the Odin Project course.

Before:
I've finished html, and css. They were tough, but doable. I have no idea what the hell I'm doing with javascript now. It's all hieroglyphs. The task is to make a simple rock paper scissors game in the console. I don't even know how to randomize something. Time to google.

Update:
Finished a very basic console game. It takes your answer, plays against the computer, and outputs it into the console. It ends when either the player or computer reaches a score of 5. Took me a while to make the code clean, and to figue out the loop. But it works, and I couldn't be happier.
